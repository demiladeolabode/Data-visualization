## Dataset


The data consists of information regarding 183,412 rows and 15 columns, including, member details, trip duration and time details. The dataset can be found in the repository alongside an html file containing code to the build up of the analysis and a slide presentation.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, from the univariate plots, the numeric plots(duration and age) contained outliers, and there were obvious difference in the categorical variables(user type, gender and Time). Upon further exploration for the Bivariate plots it became clear that trip durations increased on weekends and age decreased on weekends. Also the count of trips by user type indicates a relative equal trip count for customers, However upon further investigation with multivariate plot. It became evident that trip duration for subcribers are relatively the same and short but increase for customers on weekends and longer trip duration. Suprisingly there were longer trip duration at odd hours (2am to 3am).



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the influence of user type and time on age and duration. To start with, I introduced the varible of interest. Afterwards I used box plot to explore the relationship between age, duration and usertype, time and gender. Subsequently the multivariate plots shed more lights on the effect of user type and on the age, duration and day. I've made sure to use different color palettes for each quality variable to make sure it is clear that they're different between plots
